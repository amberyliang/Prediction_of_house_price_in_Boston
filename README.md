## The difference between regression and regularization
* 回歸（Regression）：
   - Regression is a statistical modeling technique used to predict the relationship between one or more independent variables (or features) and a dependent variable (or target).
   - Typically used for continuous target variables, it models the relationship between input features and output as a function.
   - Common regression methods include linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, etc.

* 正則化（Regularization）：
   - Regularization is a technique used to control the complexity of machine learning models and prevent overfitting.
   - By adding an additional penalty term to the model's loss function, regularization can constrain the size of model parameters, reducing sensitivity to training data and improving generalization.
   - Common regularization methods include L1 regularization (Lasso), L2 regularization (Ridge), among others.

* 差異（Differences）：
   - Regression is a modeling technique focused on learning the relationship between features and targets from data for prediction.
   - Regularization is a technique to adjust model complexity by controlling parameter sizes to prevent overfitting. It can be applied to various machine learning models, including regression models.
## Conclusion
* The R-squared of the three models is approximately 0.71, which indicates that these three models have a similar level of explanatory power regarding the target variable, and the models' fit is relatively good.
* An R-squared of about 0.71 means that these three models can explain approximately 71% of the variance in the target variable. This suggests that the models can capture most of the variance in the target variable and have a certain ability to explain the changes in the target variable.
* The accuracy of the three models is around 0.75, indicating that approximately 75% of the samples were correctly predicted. About 75% of the samples in these three models were correctly predicted.
